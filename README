* This port is based on GNOME:2 ebuilds.
* The only eclass rewritten for this port was gnome.org --> mate-desktop.org.
* Compilation related and bug fix related patches have been mostly removed or disabled.

Known issues (TODO)

* mate-base/mate-window-manager : SANDBOX ACCES VIOLATION
* mate-base/mate-session 	: Test Session/xdg stuff.


Random insult sword fighting hint:

* Insult:   	I got this scar on my face during a mighty struggle!
* Comeback:	I hope now you've learned to stop picking your nose.
